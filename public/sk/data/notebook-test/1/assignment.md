# Python Notebook Test

This is a test notebook assignment to verify the notebook implementation.

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Python notebook**! You can execute cells and see the output below each cell.

```[readonly,mustExecute]
# This cell is read-only and must execute first
import math
greeting = "Hello from Python!"
print(greeting)
```

Now you can use the `greeting` variable and `math` module in your own code.

## Your Turn

Try calculating something using the math module:

```
# Calculate the area of a circle with radius 5
radius = 5
area = math.pi * radius ** 2
print(f"Area of circle: {area}")
area
```

Great! You can also create more complex outputs:

```
# Let's print some numbers
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Number: {i}")
```

## Summary

This demonstrates the basic notebook functionality with:
- Read-only cells that must execute
- Editable cells
- Markdown sections between cells
- Persistent variables across cells
