# TODO

- [x] Write Python stdin/stderr to its own raw DOM element, so we can compare it more efficiently
- [ ] Move iFrame ready check from tests periodically checking the console to React itself (via signals, like postMessage or smth â€“ delay tests until the frame is ready)
- [ ] Fix custom embed page to work with new preview and Python API
- [ ] Generic code cleanup?
