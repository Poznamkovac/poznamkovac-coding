# TO-DO

- [x] Fix bug â€“ reloading the app entirely (F5) will not respect the `autoReload == false` setting, and will run the content in the editor regardless. When `autoReload == false`, the iframe content should only run when the user requests it.
- [ ] Will probably require thorough refactoring: When running within the same SPA state multiple times, do not entirely refresh the iframe window, so the Python/whatever code can run immediately again - only clear the variable state of the iframe (so we dont keep old variables)
